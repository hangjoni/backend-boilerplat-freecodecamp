## Learning notes:
### Day 1:
- package version formatted in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- to allow npm to prefix package to a version but update if patches are available use tilde `~`. Example: `"package": "~1.3.8"`
- to get the lastest minor version or patch, use caret `^`. Example: `"package": "^1.3.8"`
- to install node and npm on Mac: `brew install node` . Don't use apt install as that would require Java which then has nothing to do with node.
